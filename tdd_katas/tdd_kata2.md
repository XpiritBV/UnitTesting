## Board

## Before you start

- Try not to read ahead.
- Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.

## Tasks & specifications

2. Update the game engine so that a game is won when a player has three marks in the same row:
    - row 1: 1, 2, 3
    - row 2: 4, 5, 6
    - row 3: 7, 8, 9

3. Update the game engine so that a game is won when a player has three marks in the same column:
    - column 1: 1, 4, 7
    - column 2: 2, 5, 8
    - column 3: 3, 6, 9

4. Update the game engine so that a game is won when a player has three marks in a diagonal:
