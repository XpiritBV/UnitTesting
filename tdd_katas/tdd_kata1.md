# TDD Kata 1 - Tic-tac-toe Player

This kata is part of a series of exercises described in [TDD Kata - Tic-tac-toe](tdd_kata_intro.md).

## Before you start

- Try not to read ahead.
- Do one numbered task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.

## Tasks & specifications

1.  Create a `Player` class which contains the following properties:
    - `Name`
    - `Mark` (either 'X' or 'O')
    - `NumberOfMoves`
        - Ensure that initial value should be 0.
    
2.  Ensure that the `Name` and `Mark` can only be set when a player object is created. 

3.  Add a method which increases the `NumberOfMoves` with one.
