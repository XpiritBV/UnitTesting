# TDD Kata - Tic-tac-toe

This document contains a list of exercises to practice coding and refactoring in a test driven approach.

## Outline

The goal is to create a [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game.

The board consists of 9 positions.

```
    1 | 2 | 3
   ---|---|---
    4 | 5 | 6
   ---|---|---
    7 | 8 | 9
```

Each turn the player places a mark of either `X` or `O` in one of the positions.

A player has won if they have placed three marks on:
- the same row,
- the same column,
- one of the two diagonals.
