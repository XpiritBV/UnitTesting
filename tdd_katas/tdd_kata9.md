# TDD Kata 9 - Tic-tac-toe Player Stubs

This kata is part of a series of exercises described in [TDD Kata - Tic-tac-toe](tdd_kata_intro.md).

This document assumes the previous kata is completed: [TDD Kata 2 - Tic-tac-toe Moving](tdd_kata2.md).

## Before you start

- Try not to read ahead.
- Do one numbered task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.

## Tasks & specifications
1.  Refactor the unit tests which require instances of the `Player` class and use [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture) to create these `Player` instances.
