Code Coverage file per project, completely ignores runsettings:

	dotnet test Xpirit.UnittestingWorkshop\TicTacToe.Tests --collect:"Code Coverage" -- RunSettings "Xpirit.UnittestingWorkshop\TicTacToe.Tests\11 CodeCoverage\tictactoe.runsettings"

Coverlet (see https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet for options, works great with VS Code and Azure DevOps - check our magazine)

	dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true

Azure DevOps is out of scope, but you want to configure something to visualize code coverage there as well (RvM: Maybe make a demo pipeline?).
Maybe together with SonarQube.
