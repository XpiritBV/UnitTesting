	dotnet test Xpirit.UnittestingWorkshop\TicTacToe.Tests --collect:"Code Coverage" -- RunSettings "Xpirit.UnittestingWorkshop\TicTacToe.Tests\11 CodeCoverage\tictactoe.runsettings"

Coverlet (see https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet for options, works great with VS Code and Azure DevOps - check our magazine)

	dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true
